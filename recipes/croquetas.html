        <h2>What is the origin of the famous Spanish croquettes?</h2>
            <p>Croquettes arrived in Spain through French influence during the Peninsular War (1808–1814). They became a popular dish in Spanish cuisine, which adapted the original recipe using local ingredients such as ham and other leftovers. The first recorded Spanish recipe dates back to 1830.</p>

                <li>500ml Of cold whole milk</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>1 Medium egg</li>
                <li>100gr Of breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>Oil for frying</li>
            </ul> 
        
        <h2>Let's get started:</h2> 
            <ol>
                <li>Finely chop 85 g of serrano ham. Peel and finely chop 25 g of shallot or onion, and press 1 garlic clove.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Heat 50 g of butter in a pan and gently sauté the onion and garlic over low heat for 5 minutes. Add the chopped serrano ham and stir.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>In the same pan, add 50 g of all-purpose flour and toast it for 2 minutes. Then, Gradually pour in 500 ml of cold whole milk while stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps.</li> 
                    <br>
                <li>Cook the mixture for 8 minutes until the dough comes away from the sides. We taste and add salt to taste if necessary, depending on the ham used.</li>   
                    <br>
                <li>We place the croquette mixture in a piping bag, let it cool, and refrigerate it overnight or for at least 3 hours. We can also spread the mixture on a tray to shape the croquettes the traditional way using two spoons.</li>    
                    <br>
                <li>To shape the croquettes, we pipe lines of dough onto a tray and cut them into equal portions. Then, we shape the croquettes into an oval form.</li>    
                    <br>
                <li>Beat 1 medium egg on a plate and coat the croquettes first in the beaten egg, then in 100 g of breadcrumbs. If you prefer them crunchier, you can double-coat them by dipping them again in egg and breadcrumbs. At this point, you can freeze them by placing them in the freezer separately. Once frozen, they can be stored together in a properly labeled bag.</li>    
                    <br>
                <li>Fry the croquettes in hot oil at 180°C (356°F) for 2 minutes until golden, then drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>    
                    <br>
                <li>Now we can serve the croquettes and enjoy!</li>    
            </ol>
