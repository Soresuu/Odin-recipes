        <h2>What is a lasagna?</h2>
            <p>Lasagna, also known by the plural form <strong>lasagne</strong>, is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine, it is used to make the dish lasagna by stacking layers of pasta, alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The resulting dish is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>

                    <li>1/2 Teaspoon of salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 Teaspoon of groun white pepper</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>To assemble:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 Lasagna sheets</li>
                    <li>50g Grated cheese </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Let's get started</h2>
                <ol>
                <li>For the meat filling, peel and finely chop 2 cloves of garlic, 2 small onions (or 1 large one), 2 celery stalks, and 1 carrot. Heat 50 ml of extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan and sauté the vegetables over low heat for 15 minutes, along with 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of herbes de Provence.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Chop 5 slices of bacon and, once the vegetables are ready, add it to the saucepan along with 800 g of minced beef. Stir over high heat for a couple of minutes to break up the meat and prevent it from clumping.</li>
                    <br>      
                <li>Once the meat has changed color, add 650 g of crushed tomatoes and 15 g of tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste, keeping in mind that the vegetables have already been seasoned, and simmer the mixture over low heat for 45 minutes or until you get a thick but juicy sauce.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce by melting 80 g of butter in a deep pan and adding 80 g of all-purpose flour. Stir to combine both ingredients and form a <em>roux</em> (A roux is a mixture of fat and flour cooked together, used to thicken liquids.).</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Next, gradually add 800 ml of milk and, while heating it over medium heat, whisk continuously to incorporate it without forming lumps. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of ground white pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>With the meat filling and béchamel sauce ready, the next step is to <strong>assemble the lasagna</strong>. Cover the bottom of a rectangular baking dish with a layer of béchamel sauce to prevent the lasagna from sticking and to make it easier to portion and serve.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Layer the lasagna sheets, meat filling, and a little béchamel sauce (optional) until you reach almost the top of the dish, finishing with a layer of pasta and generously pouring béchamel over the lasagna.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Sprinkle the top with 50 g of grated cheese (I used Cheddar) and bake in the oven, preheated to 200°C (392°F) with top and bottom heat, for 30 minutes or according to the instructions on the pasta package. Once the lasagna is golden on top, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>And that's how you can make a delicious lasagna. It takes some time but it is totally worth it!</p>
